<p>We are all global citizens. We all live on this hunk of rock and lava that we call Earth. Therefore, we have certain responsibilities to it. Do you clean your home or apartment? Hopefully you said yes. If so, why not keep the Earth clean? After all, we do live (at least some of us). It is our home. I could sit here and shove global warming down your throat, but I won’t (even though it is happening).</p>
<p>Here at GMD, we believe that you shouldn’t be socially responsible because people tell you to be. Social responsibility is more than changing to CFL light bulbs or “going green.” It’s about keeping our home, Earth, clean, regardless of whether that is through helping the less fortunate, recycling, or reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, I have a proposition for you. You need something that is going to help clean this world, something that does not harm the environment or at least harms it less. But you shouldn’t have to sacrifice comfort for social responsibility. I have an idea... how about a bamboo t-shirt?</p>
