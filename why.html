<p>Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants in the world. It can be selectively harvested every year after 7 years, compared to 30 to 50 years for trees, and bamboo regenerates without replanting. Bamboo is native to every continent, in some form, except Europe and the poles. China has an abundant resource of bamboo with over 400 species. For years, the Chinese have been making bamboo products.</p>
<p>Bamboo tolerates extremes of drought and drowning, generates 30% more oxygen than trees and is considered a critical element in the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Because of its wide spread root system and large canopy, bamboo greatly reduces rain run off and prevents massive soil erosion. Bamboo has high nitrogen consumption, making it a solution for excess nutrient uptake of waste water from manufacturing, livestock farming and sewage treatment.</p>
<p>Bamboo is one of the strongest building materials on earth. Because of its great tensile strength, its capacity for splitting straight, its hardness, its peculiar cross-section, and the ease with which it can be grown - a combination of useful traits found together in no other plant - bamboo is one of those providential developments in nature which, like the horse, the cow, wheat and cotton, have been indirectly responsible for human evolution.</p>
